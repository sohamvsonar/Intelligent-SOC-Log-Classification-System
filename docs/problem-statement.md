# Problem Statement

## Overview

Organizations and development teams face significant challenges in monitoring and analyzing log data from their systems. Traditional log monitoring approaches are inadequate for modern applications that generate large volumes of diverse log messages.

## Current Challenges

### 1. Limitations of Log Level-Based Monitoring

**Why log level-based monitoring is not perfect:**
- Programmers do not write perfect logs
- Logs involve heavy code and lots of other factors  
- Current systems are just based on keywords (e.g., error, warning, etc.) but not built at functional/actionable level
- Lack of contextual understanding beyond basic severity levels

### 2. Inadequate Classification Categories

Current monitoring systems focus on basic log levels but miss critical operational categories:
- **Security alerts** are not properly identified
- **Resource usage** patterns are overlooked  
- **Workflow errors** are not distinguished from general errors

### 3. Specific Problem Scenarios

#### Security Concerns
- **Multiple login failures**: Systems fail to detect patterns like 500+ login attempts
- **Abnormal system behavior**: Unable to identify unusual server activity
- **I/O and security breaches**: Critical security events go unnoticed

#### Resource Management Issues  
- **Memory limit exceeded**: Instances consuming excessive resources (e.g., 20MB+ usage)
- **Physical memory monitoring**: Systems with high memory usage (e.g., 8.394.6 MB physical, 512MB used) need better tracking
- **Resource exhaustion**: Inability to predict and prevent resource-related failures

#### Workflow Disruptions
- **Escalation errors**: Failed ticket escalation processes (e.g., PID 3295, undefined escalation level)
- **Task assignment failures**: Team assignment errors (e.g., team 149 could not complete tasks)
- **Process breakdown**: Critical workflow interruptions that impact business operations

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Volume and Variety
- Large volumes of log data generated by modern applications
- Diverse log formats and structures across different systems
- Real-time processing requirements for timely alerts

### 2. Accuracy vs Performance Trade-off
- Need for high accuracy in classification
- Requirement for fast processing to enable real-time monitoring
- Balance between computational cost and classification quality

### 3. Scalability Requirements
- System must handle growing log volumes
- Need to adapt to new log types without extensive retraining
- Support for distributed systems and microservices architectures

## Proposed Solution Requirements

The Log Classification System must address these challenges by:

1. **Intelligent Classification**: Moving beyond simple keyword matching to context-aware classification
2. **Actionable Categories**: Providing meaningful categories that enable specific operational responses
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Combining multiple AI techniques for optimal performance and cost
4. **Real-time Processing**: Enabling immediate response to critical events
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Supporting enterprise-scale log processing requirements

## Success Criteria

A successful solution should:
- Accurately classify logs into actionable categories (Security Alert, Resource Usage, Workflow Error)
- Provide faster response times compared to manual log analysis
- Reduce false positives and negatives in critical event detection
- Scale efficiently with increasing log volumes
- Maintain cost-effectiveness through optimized processing approaches
